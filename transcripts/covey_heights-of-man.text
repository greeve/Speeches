Heights of Man

Ricks College Devotional

BYU Idaho devotional

---

I am so very thrilled to be with you again; honored by this invitation very deeply; appreciate the invitation of the associated mens students to speak on the subject of the heights of men. 

I would like to ask you to try and visualize my objective is for my speech today

My purpose and objective, which I feel very, very deeply about, is to help us to build our lives and our characters on the Living Christ. 

To provide a little encouragement and inspritation to that end.

I feel very deeply in need of the Holy Spirit to serve that purpose.

I would like to describe five situations to lay these problems out and to show how this object might truly solve these problems.

Some of you may identify with some of these situations; I hope that you do to some degree.

First, a friend of mine called me about his discouragement. 

He had been going with this girl for some period of time. 

They had high hopes to go together; to build their futures together.

And he could begin to see and sense that she was losing her interest in him.

He built almost his entire life around this relationship.

And as he could see the handwritting on the wall he felt that she was losing her insterest in him caused him to drop out of almost everything. Including school. He wouldn't come to classes and also church.

He would have what he called "where we stand conversations". 

"How do you feel about me?"

"Do you feel the same?"

"I feel this way about you. Do you feel the same?"

"Do you still have the same plans for the future?"

And she would say essentially yes.

But not with the same kind of natural, spontaneous enthusiasm of her earlier times with him.

And he sensed that. 

And he would press her.

I sensed that somethings wrong. What is it?

Oh its nothing, nothing. 

And he'd press her.

And his love for her was based in a sense out of his own need for her first.

And he began to force natural processes and the more he did this the more she became less interested in him emotionally even though she said she was.

And then he became more possessive of her and more jealous of her intrests and attentions; not just in other fellows but in anything where he was not the center part of it.

The second problem you might supply out of your own memory. 

This is the problem of being offended.

How many of you here have had experiences with someone that has deeply; someone you cared about perhaps; a roommate or some person who unjustly dealt with you so strongly that it offended you deeply and you haven't yet perhaps yet got over it. 

How many have had experiences like that?

And even now maybe may be feeling some of that?

The third problem 

The first problem we will call the fear of rejection.

The second problem being offended.

The third problem being disillusioned.

How many of you have had experiences where you identified with a particular individual a hero in your mind and then later were disillusioned by his behavior?

Or perhaps you were disillusioned when a leader even a leader in the church demonstrated some human weakness and you had such a high hope of his being at a much higher level than everybody else that it was very disillusioning to you to have that kind of experience with that person.

How many have experienced that?

I had a friend just the other day; a student who had written to a leader completely openly and innocently seeking for a particular service; a help. 

And his letter I think was probably misunderstood and the net result was that it came down from other channels and he was criticized for writing this leader.

And it really toppled him.

He was hurt; he was disillusioned; it made him really doubt the church itself.

We will call that the third case. 

The fourth case is a person who is rather alieanted from himself; who feels lonely and who feels perhaps apathy and life becomes kind of a mechanical process where he's not close to his own feelings or close to other people's feelings.

The world is rather cold and unloving and also his own feelings become that way. 

How many of us experience that from time to time?

The last case would be the case of a person feeling unworthy.

It may be due to earlier transgression or certain other almost unconscious forces that makes a person feels like I'm not worth very much; I'm not a very worthy person; I'm not really capable to serve in a leader position or to go on a mission; or to be married in the temple; or to get good grades; or to merit the trust of a person that is in a leadership position whom may know better, and so forth. 

People have a tendancy to compare themselves to other people so much. 

And often parents and teachers and leaders have a tendancy to give love on such a conditional basis as to encourage more of this comparing and people's emotional lives being based upon these external
